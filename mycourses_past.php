/**
 * Opens Moodle's standard "My courses" page with the course overview filtered to past courses.
 *
 * /my/courses.php takes no parameters - the block_myoverview filter lives in a user preference.
 * So we set that preference and redirect. Used by the "Zur Uebersicht" button below the
 * Wissensbasis carousel, which should land users on their completed courses.
